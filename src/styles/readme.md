Sass in this project follows the 'Sass Guidelines' [recommendation](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture): The 7-1 Pattern

`main.scss` will be where all the scss gets imported and compiled.

- `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. In there, you might find the reset file, some typographic rules, and probably a stylesheet defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements (that I like to call _base.scss).

- `layout/` or `partials/` folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebar…), the grid system or even CSS styles for all the forms.

- `components/` is more focused on widgets while `layout/` is macro (defining the global wireframe). It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in `components/` since the whole site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.

- `pages/` folder for page-specific styles, in a file named after the page. For instance, it’s not uncommon to have very specific styles for the home page hence the need for a _home.scss file in `pages/`.

- `themes/` folder for different themes.

 - `abstracts/` folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here. The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.

 - `vendors/` folder containing all the CSS files from external libraries and frameworks – Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI, FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on. Putting those aside in the same folder is a good way to say “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility”.

Ideally, something like this...
